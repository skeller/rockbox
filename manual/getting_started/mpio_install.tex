  Installing the bootloader is the trickiest part of the installation.
  As explained above, we cannot distribute the bootloader directly, and
  thus need to patch a compatible version of the MPIO firmware, which
  can be downloaded as described above.


\begin{enumerate}
   \item Download official Rockbox bootloader for MPIO HD200 from
   \url {http://download.rockbox.org/bootloader/mpio/hd200}
   and save it to your desktop. The archive contains three files: bootloader.mpio, 
   bootloader.map and rockbox-info.txt. The first file is actual bootloader, two
   others can be used for debugging and are irrelevant for end user.
   \item Download mkmpioboot utility from \url{http://download.rockbox.org/bootloader/mpio/mkmpioboot}
   \item Process previously downloaded official firmware to include rockbox bootloader.
   Open terminal window and type the following command:
     \begin{code}
       mkmpioboot HD200_UPG.SYS bootloader.mpio HD200_UPG.rb
     \end{code}
   \item Copy \fname{HD200\_UPG.rb} to the SYSTEM folder of your \dap{} and rename back to
   \fname{HD200\_UPG.SYS}
   \item Safe eject your \dap{}
   \item Connect Wall charger and turn on the device. This should trigger firmware
   upgrade process which will install rockbox bootloader to the flash memory of the
   player.
\end{enumerate}
